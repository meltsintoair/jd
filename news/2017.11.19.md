#### Social Media is a State Weapon ####   
> 'Governments in Venezuela, the Philippines, Turkey and elsewhere use social media to influence elections, drive agendas and counter critics, says report'– [Thirty countries use 'armies of opinion shapers' to manipulate democracy – report](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/14/social-media-influence-election-countries-armies-of-opinion-shapers-manipulate-democracy-fake-news)

Notice that this report is from **Freedom House** which is 95%+ funded by the US State Department – what it says might be accurate, but what they analize and why is biased by this fact.  Things are changing at Trump's State Dept - Venezuela is still a #1 target as it was under Obama, but the other two less so now. I wonder if Tillerson will slash funding for Freedom House like he has for so many other State Dept staff and programs?

#### Database Tracks History Of U.S. Meddling In Foreign Elections ####

>NPR's Ari Shapiro talks to Carnegie Mellon University researcher Dov Levin about his historical database that tracks U.S. involvement in meddling with foreign elections over the years.

**Ari Shapiro**: How often do other countries like Russia, for example, try to alter the outcome of elections as compared to the United States?

**Dov Levin**: Well, for my dataset, the United States is the most common user of this technique. Russia or the Soviet Union since 1945 has used it half as much. My estimate has been 36 cases between 1946 to 2000.
