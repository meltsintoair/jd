#### Social Media is a State Weapon ####   
> 'Governments in Venezuela, the Philippines, Turkey and elsewhere use social media to influence elections, drive agendas and counter critics, says report'– [Thirty countries use 'armies of opinion shapers' to manipulate democracy – report](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/14/social-media-influence-election-countries-armies-of-opinion-shapers-manipulate-democracy-fake-news)

Notice that this report is from **Freedom House** which is 95%+ funded by the US State Department – what it says might be accurate, but what they analize and why is biased by this fact.  Things are changing at Trump's State Dept - Venezuela is still a #1 target as it was under Obama, but the other two less so now. I wonder if Tillerson will slash funding for Freedom House like he has for so many other State Dept staff and programs?
