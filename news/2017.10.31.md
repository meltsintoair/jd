Josh Marshall has a good question – this just shows how deep the civil war myths and excuses for slavery go in White America, not just *this* White House but also to the top levels of the US Military that he commanded under Obama. /jd

> Josh Marshall '...Why is John Kelly talking about Robert E. Lee? Let alone praising him or attacking him, why is Lee even a topic of discussion? Kelly is an Irish Catholic from Boston born in 1950. He is not someone born in the Deep South who was reared in the Lee cult and coming to grips with that legacy or unable to shake it fully. Why is this even something we’re talking about?...' ––  http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/total-quality-trumpism
