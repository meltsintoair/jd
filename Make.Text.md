### How to make editable text out of audio and images

I have been collecting interesting and obcue webservices for a while and enither organizing them well, nor sharing them with the world.  Let this page be that space...

* How to transcribe text from a jpeg/png/gif

If you have a photo or screenshot of some words and want the text, do the following

* get a Google account, sign into it
   * go to [https://keep.google.com](https://keep.google.com)
   * drag the jpeg/gif/png file to the browser screen where it says 'Take a note...'
   * It will upload (this might take a few moment, be pateint
   * click on the 3 verticle dots on the right side
   * choose 'Grab image text' – again be patient
   * Scroll the post downward and find the text
   * select all text and copy it and then past it into the text editor of your own choice
   * the text will probably be poorly formatted and with some errors – you will have to take the time to fix this
   * but,,, Voila!! text from an image! 

* How to transcribe from an audio file
    * **oTranscribe** 
    – Type it yourself using [http://otranscribe.com](http://otranscribe.com)
    upload an mp3 or wav file to the site.
    
    use the  x, x and x buttones to move the curser back and forth when transcribing
      
    * **Deepgram** 
    – Use [http://Deepgram.com](http://Deepgram.com) to automatically transcribe
    upload a mp3 or other audio/video file to their server and give it a moment and a transcription will automatically appear.
    
    DeepGram does not make a perfect transcription, and it will not provide punctuation and fix your bad grammar, and it will often misjudge the words.  You will have to go through the text and audio together several time to fine tune the text to perfection.  But so much time and effort is saved with this nice webservice.
